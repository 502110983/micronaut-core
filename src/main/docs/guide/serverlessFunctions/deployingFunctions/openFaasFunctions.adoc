When creating a function you can use the `openfaas` feature to create a function that includes a `Dockerfile` that can be built into a docker image deployable to OpenFaas as well as the `function.yml` needed to deploy the function in OpenFaas:

.Creating an OpenFaaS Function
[source,bash]
----
$ mn create-function hello-world-function --features openfaas
----

== Manual deployment
 
To deploy the function manually the image should first be build using the OpenFaas cli:
 
[source,bash]
----
$ faas-cli build -f function.yml
----
 
The image can then be pushed to a registry. This will be the registry as specified in the image in the `function.yml`:
 
[source,bash]
----
$ faas-cli push -f function.yml
----
 
Once the image pushed in the registry, the function can be deployed in the cluster:
 
[source,bash]
----
$ faas-cli deploy -f function.yml
----

This will deploy the function in the namespace `openfaas-fn`.

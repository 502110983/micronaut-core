To get a collection of all loggers by name with their configured and effective log levels,
send a GET request to /logging. This will also provide a list of the available log levels.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/logging

{
    "levels": [
        "ALL", "TRACE", "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARN", "ERROR", "OFF", "NOT_SPECIFIED"
    ],
    "logging": {
        "ROOT": {
            "configuredLevel": "INFO",
            "effectiveLevel": "INFO"
        },
        "io": {
            "configuredLevel": "NOT_SPECIFIED",
            "effectiveLevel": "INFO"
        },
        "io.micronaut": {
            "configuredLevel": "NOT_SPECIFIED",
            "effectiveLevel": "INFO"
        },
        // etc...
    }
}
----

To get the log levels of a particular logger, include the logger name in your GET request. For
example, to access the log levels of the logger 'io.micronaut.http':

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/logging/io.micronaut.http

{
    "configuredLevel": "NOT_SPECIFIED",
    "effectiveLevel": "INFO"
}
----

If the named logger does not exist, it will be created with an unspecified (i.e. `NOT_SPECIFIED`)
configured log level. (It's effective log level will usually be that of the root logger.)

To update the log level of a single logger, send a POST request to the named logger URL and include
a body providing the log level to configure.


[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i -X POST
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{ "configuredLevel": "ERROR" }' \
       http://localhost:8080/logging/ROOT

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

$ curl http://localhost:8080/logging/ROOT

{
    "configuredLevel": "ERROR",
    "effectiveLevel": "ERROR"
}

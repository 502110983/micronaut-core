Micronaut {version} includes the following changes:

=== Initial Support for HTTP/2

Micronaut's Netty-based HTTP client and server have been updated to support HTTP/2.

HTTP/2 support on the server can be enabled by configuring <<https, HTTPS>> and then setting the supported HTTP version:

.HTTP/2 Server
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
    ssl:
        enabled: true
        buildSelfSigned: true
    server:
        http-version: 2.0
----

You can inject an HTTP/2 client by specifying `version` in the ann:http.client.annotation.Client[] annotation:

.HTTP/2 Client
[source,java]
----
@Inject
@Client(version=HttpVersion.HTTP_2_0)
RxHttpClient client;
----

=== Improved Support for Server-Side Content Negotiation

Micronaut will now correctly handle the HTTP `Accept` header and pick the most appropriate route for the specified accepted media types using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation[Server-Side Content Negotiation].

NOTE: This also applies to `@Error` routes making it possible to send different error responses for different content types

TIP: To add XML support see the https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-jackson-xml[Jackson XML] plugin

=== Event Loop Group Improvements

Micronaut 2.0 uses a new shared default Netty `EventLoopGroup` for server worker threads and client request threads. This reduces context switching and improves resource utilization.

See the <<clientConfiguration, HTTP Client Configuration>> section for information on how to configure the default `EventLoopGroup` and add additional `EventLoopGroup`'s that are configured per client.

=== HTTP Client Improvements

It is no longer necessary to use `@Client(..)` to inject a default api:http.client.RxHttpClient[] instance. You can now inject the default client simply with:

[source,java]
----
@Inject RxHttpClient client;
----

If no host is provided at the time of a request, a api:http.client.exceptions.NoHostException[] will be thrown.

=== Spot Bugs Instead of JSR-305 Nullable/NonNull Annotations

In Micronaut 1.x the Google distributed JSR-305 annotations library (`com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305`) was used to specify `@Nullable` and `@NonNull` on interfaces of the Micronaut API using the annotations contained within the `javax.annotation` package.

Due to the fact that JSR-305 has been cancelled and that this dependency has potential licensing issues (by using the `javax` namespace) as well as problems with the cross packages on Java 9+ with the module system Micronaut 2.x switches to the `spotbugs-annotations` module provided by the https://spotbugs.github.io/[SpotBugs project].

It is recommended users of Micronaut use this API instead (although the `javax.annotation.Nullable` and `javax.annotation.NotNull` annotations continue to be supported).

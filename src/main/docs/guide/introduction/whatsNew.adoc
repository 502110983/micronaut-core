Micronaut {version} includes the following changes:

=== Core Features

==== Banner

A new customizable banner is now displayed when the application starts up. See <<_micronaut_banner, Micronaut Banner>> for more information.

==== Improved Support for Records

Java 14+ Records can now be used to define <<configurationProperties, Configuration Properties>>. By default when `@ConfigurationProperties` is used on a `record`, configuration injection is applied. For example:

[source,java]
----
package example;
import io.micronaut.context.annotation.*;
import javax.validation.constraints.*;

@ConfigurationProperties("example")
record Example(@Min(20) int num, String name) {
}
----

==== Bean Introspections Now Support Execution Handles

A api:core.beans.BeanIntrospection[] can now declare methods that should generate reflection free execution handles. This feature allows calling other methods (besides setters) on introspections without using reflection.

==== Improved Support for Copy Constructors and Immutable Types

An immutable api:core.beans.BeanIntrospection[] (like Java Records as mentioned above) requires different handling when you need to create a new instance with a particular property modified. A typical pattern for this is to construct a new instance passing all the existing values plus the modified value (see for example https://projectlombok.org/features/With[Lombok's @With]).

Micronaut's Bean Introspections now support this pattern. For example:

[source,java]
----
val introspection = BeanIntrospection.getIntrospection(Example.java);
Example example = introspection.instantiate(10, "Test");
assertEquals(10, example.num());
example = introspection.getRequiredProperty("num", int.class)
             .withValue(example, 20);
assertEquals(20, example.num());
----

The new `withValue` method will automatically create a new instance populating the existing properties and returning the instance.

Micronaut will at compilation time compute an efficient copy-constructor approach that will only return a new instance if the value changes.

=== HTTP Features

==== Locale Resolution

A new interface api:http.server.util.HttpLocaleResolver[] has been introduced to support resolving a locale from a given request in multiple ways. A `java.util.Locale` object can now be a parameter to controller and client methods to automatically bind the locale to/from the request. See <<localeResolution, the documentation>> for more information.

==== Host Resolution

It is now possible to validate a resolved host against a list regular expressions patterns. See <<hostResolution, the documentation>> for more information.

=== Cloud Features

==== New CI/CD Deployment Workflows for Github Actions in Launch

https://micronaut.io/launch/[Micronaut Launch] has been updated to include CI/CD workflows to deploy to common container based Cloud environments including Oracle Cloud Function, Azure Container Instance and Google Cloud Run.

Combined with the ability to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4AKGf1TlXM[Push to Github] this makes it a breeze to setup Micronaut applications to be deployed to the Cloud.

==== Google Cloud Secret Manager

Thanks to a contribution by https://github.com/viniciusccarvalho[Vinicius Carvalho], Micronaut GCP supports distributed configuration via Google Cloud Secret Manager.

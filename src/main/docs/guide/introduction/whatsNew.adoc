Micronaut {version} includes the following changes:

=== Client Filter Matching By Annotation

Micronaut HTTP clients and client filters can now be matched by the presence of an annotation. Previously only URL matching was supported. See <<_filter_matching_by_annotation,the documentation>> to get started.

=== @Requires OS

The ann:context.annotation.Requires[] annotation now has support for disabling beans based on the current operating system.

=== Basic Auth binding support

In the client and server, an argument of type api:http.BasicAuth[] can be used to generate or parse a basic authorization header.
